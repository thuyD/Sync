# Sync

Sync is a music visualization app, built using Web Audio Api and HTML5 Canvas.

### Sync allows users to:
* Users can choose from three different type of inputs: play a sample track, play an audio file from your computer, or use a microphone for live input. For the best experience, I recommended using a microphone from your headphone to reduce background noise rather than the build-in microphone from your computer.
* Stylistic options include a color bar that dynamically adjusts the color of the visualizer base on your relative click position. You can also choose to cycle through colors, which changes every three seconds.
* Select from two different styles of visualizer: waveform or ripple.
